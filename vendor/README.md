Any vendor folder (usually just one besides app) will have its contents concatenated, much like app, with a significant difference: its script files will not get wrapped in modules. You’d generally put there third-party libraries that do not play well with being wrapped as modules (no UMD-style loader, etc.). You’d also put there code that is capable of being wrapped, but that your current codebase still relies on as globals (for now :wink:) instead of using require(…).
