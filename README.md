FILE STRUCTURE:

/stylesheets/app - our application's CSS

/stylesheets/vendor- anything from a bower component, that we didnt write.

/assets/ - CSS Assets that are selectively rendered, at runtime, by browser, are for now put in as static assets in the /app/assets folder. This is because Brunch auto concatenates everything based on the brunch-config.js and I have no time to figure out the necessary regular expressions to exclude selectively. 

-------------

TODO:
- split out CSS in /assets into ltie8/app and ltie8/vendor, etc?
- post Q to jason bigsby
- set up partials, to reuse panels, and cut down on responsive images markup
- make square crops for main image
